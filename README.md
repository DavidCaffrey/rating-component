## Overview
This project involved making cards, modals that where interactive with the use of javascript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I built out the html elements first then went about styling the project from a mobile first perspective. Once the styling was complete I turned
to the funtionality of the elements with javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
